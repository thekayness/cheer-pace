CheerPace!

Self-paced courses are hard to stay motivated in, let's change this by cheering each other on!  CheerPace is meant to be a place where we can (gently) hold each other accountable for finishing that awesome online course we still haven't finished. Users can:
	-enter a course
	-enter/update tasks associated with a course
	-offer others encouragement with their courses

* Ruby version ~ 2.3.1
